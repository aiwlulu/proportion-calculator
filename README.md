# Proportion Calculator

A sleek and intuitive web application for performing proportion calculations. Enter any three values, and the app will calculate the fourth.

## Features

- Easily calculate proportional relationships by entering any three of the four variables: A, B, C, and D.
- Real-time input validation ensures only numeric values are accepted.
- Reset all fields with a single click for quick recalculations.

## Usage

1. Enter values into **three of the four fields** (A, B, C, D).
2. Click **Calculate** to determine the missing value.
3. Use the **Reset** button to clear all fields and start a new calculation.

### Formula Used

The proportion calculator solves the equation:

> **_A / B = C / D_**

Based on this relationship, the missing variable is computed as follows:

> **D** = (B × C) / A

> **C** = (A × D) / B

> **B** = (A × D) / C

> **A** = (B × C) / D
